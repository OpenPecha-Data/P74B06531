A Brief Prayer to the Precious Master Padmākara for Swiftly Fulfilling Wishes
by Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo

om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
kyabné kündü orgyen rinpoche
Embodiment of all sources of refuge, Orgyen Rinpoche,
zömé dungshuk drakpö solwa deb
To you we pray, with a yearning so strong it is hard to bear.
chi nang sangwé barché ying su sol
Dispel all obstacles, outer, inner and secret, into space
samdön chö shyin drubpar jingyi lob
And grant your blessing so all our aims and wishes are fulfilled, according to the Dharma.

With single-minded devotion, Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo made this prayer, which arose quite spontaneously,
on its own. Virtue!
